# Web Deployment with a Twist: S3 and CloudFront

The team, now brimming with confidence and enthusiasm, gears up for the grand finale of their cloud adventure. With a mix of expertise and humor, they turn their attention to deploying the website, a task that promises to be both challenging and entertaining.

## Task 3: S3 Bucket and CloudFront Deployment

**Objective:** Deploy an S3 bucket to host the website content and set up a CloudFront distribution.
**Goal:** Ensure the website is accessible and performs well.
**Optional Challenge:** As a creative touch, design a humorous 404 error page for the website, maybe referencing the journey from Terraform to CDK. This playful element will not only showcase their technical prowess but also their journey and the fun they've had along the way.
