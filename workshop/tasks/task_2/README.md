# Securing the Highway: Vehicle API and WAF Deployment

Inspired by their earlier success, the team dives into their next challenge. They approach the Vehicle API and WAF deployment with both confidence and a light-hearted spirit.

## Task 2: Vehicle API and WAF Deployment

**Objective:** Set up the Vehicle API and implement WAF for security using AWS WAF.
**Goal:** Integrate the Vehicle API with AWS WAF to protect against common web threats. The team will configure the WAF with a regional scope and rules for rate limiting and geo-blocking, enabling CloudWatch metrics for detailed monitoring. By associating the WAF with the APIâ€™s resource ARN, the team aims to ensure that the API is not just operational but also secure and well-guarded against potential threats. This integration marks a pivotal step in bolstering their cloud infrastructure's security and resilience.
